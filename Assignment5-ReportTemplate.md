# Introduction
The purpose of this lab was to become familiar with integration analysis techniques using Reliabilty Growth Testing and Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). Using data given in a CSV form, integration analysis will be performed and plotted using tools such as CSFRAT or SRTAT. The data that will be plotted using these tools will be the failure rate and reliability. Gaining understanding of the usefulness of reliabilty growth testing, measuring MTTF, failure rate, and reliability will be important aspects of the laboratory.

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
  Team work was divided equally, as all team members worked together one each part of the lab. Each member of the team went through the familirization of CSFRAT and SRTAT, and were responsiblle on checking the coverage of the tests. As a team we went through the graphs and chart and determined from which we were able to visualize the data. Through this process we were able to familiarize ourselves with RDCs and RGT. Finally, the lab report writeup, was split equally between members. Throughout the lab, each member was responsible for keeping each other accountable, and make sure that the work was done in time.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
 We learned the importance of utilizing RDC and RGT, and how to implement them in the different tools we used. In part 1, we utilized CSFRAT in order to convert the failure data provided into different graphs and models. For part 2, we utilized SRTAT to create RDC's and how the different variables, such as customer risk, developer risk, and failures per second manipulated it.
 
 Our group found difficulty using SRTAT for the relaibiilty growth testing section, thus we had to resort to using CSFRAT instead.
